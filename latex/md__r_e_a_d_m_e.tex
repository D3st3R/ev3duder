The L\+E\+G\+OÂ® E\+V3 Downloader/\+Uploader utility.

ev3duder is an implementation of the L\+E\+G\+O E\+V3\textquotesingle{}s protocol over U\+S\+B (H\+I\+D), Bluetooth (R\+F\+C\+O\+M\+M) and Wi\+Fi (T\+C\+P).

Click here for precompiled binaries for Linux, Windows and O\+S X. Building ev3duder on your own is quite easy too, though. \subsection*{Compiling ev3duder}

ev3duder requires a gnu99 compatible compiler, that is G\+C\+C 3.\+2 and above or compatible compilers. Any recent version of gcc, clang or icc should be able to compile it. M\+S Visual C++ isn\textquotesingle{}t supported, due to the use of C99 features and G\+N\+U extensions. Also required is G\+N\+U Make.

\subsubsection*{Getting the source}

Get the source with git\+: \$ git clone --recursive \href{https://github.com/a3f/ev3duder}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/a3f/ev3duder} If you haven\textquotesingle{}t got git, you will have to download these seperately\+: \href{https://github.com/a3f/ev3duder/archive/master.zip}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/a3f/ev3duder/archive/master.\+zip} and \href{https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/archive/master.zip}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/signal11/hidapi/archive/master.\+zip} then unpack the hidapi archive into the hidapi directory of the ev3duder extraction path.

\subsubsection*{Building from source}

\$ make \paragraph*{Linux}

On Linux, you additionally need libusb-\/1.\+0 to be installed. On Ubuntu and other Debian-\/based system this can be done via \$ sudo apt-\/get install libusb1.\+0.\+0-\/dev Also to allow access to the ev3 over U\+S\+B without requiring root, appropriate udev rules must be created. This can be easily done with \$ make install \subsubsection*{Tests}

The test/ directionry contains some sample projects that do stuff on the E\+V3. {\ttfamily perl flash.\+pl Test\+\_\+\+Motors} uploads and executes the Test\+\_\+\+Motors project.

\subsection*{Compiling programs for the E\+V3}

Generally, 2 files are needed\+: 1) An E\+L\+F executable built for Linux on A\+R\+M. libc need not be dynamically linked (The standard firmware uses glibc). stdlibc++ is {\itshape not} provided by default and would need to be uploaded separately and dynamically loaded or linked statically (e.\+g. by specifying -\/static-\/libstdc++ during linking with G\+C\+C 4.\+5+).

2) A launcher file, so the program can be started from the built-\/in menu. This is not strictly required, as ev3duder can execute programs too, but a menu entry is more convenient.

\subsection*{Compiling for E\+V3 using gcc}

\subsubsection*{Getting the toolchain}

In order to compile C/\+C++ application you will need the arm-\/none-\/linux-\/gnueabi G\+C\+C or arm-\/linux-\/gnueabi G\+C\+C (Both are the same thing). The {\ttfamily symlink\+\_\+cross.\+sh} script can be used to symlink the latter to the former.

\paragraph*{Windows}

Easiest way is via the Code\+Sourcery Lite package which can be gotten here\+: \href{https://sourcery.mentor.com/GNUToolchain/package4574/public/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2009q1-203-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.exe}{\tt https\+://sourcery.\+mentor.\+com/\+G\+N\+U\+Toolchain/package4574/public/arm-\/none-\/linux-\/gnueabi/arm-\/2009q1-\/203-\/arm-\/none-\/linux-\/gnueabi.\+exe}

\paragraph*{Linux}

Debian/\+Ubuntu offer the Linaro toolchain in the repositories, but I couldn\textquotesingle{}t get it to work. Code\+Sourcery to the rescue again\+: \$ wget -\/c \href{http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package4571/public/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2009q1-203-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2}{\tt http\+://www.\+codesourcery.\+com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package4571/public/arm-\/none-\/linux-\/gnueabi/arm-\/2009q1-\/203-\/arm-\/none-\/linux-\/gnueabi-\/i686-\/pc-\/linux-\/gnu.\+tar.\+bz2} For C++\+: \$ mkdir Code\+Sourcery \$ tar -\/jxvf $\sim$/arm-\/2009q1-\/203-\/arm-\/none-\/linux-\/gnueabi-\/i686-\/pc-\/linux-\/gnu.tar.\+bz2 -\/\+C $\sim$/\+Code\+Sourcery/ \$ echo export P\+A\+T\+H=$\sim$/\+Code\+Sourcery/arm-\/2009q1/bin/\+:\$\+P\+A\+T\+H $>$$>$ $\sim$/.bashrc \&\& . $\sim$/.bashrc

\paragraph*{O\+S X}

Carlson-\/\+Minot Inc. provides binary builds of Code\+Sourcery\textquotesingle{}s G\+N\+U/\+A\+R\+M toolchain for O\+S X. It can be gotten here\+: \href{http://www.carlson-minot.com/available-arm-gnu-linux-g-lite-builds-for-mac-os-x}{\tt http\+://www.\+carlson-\/minot.\+com/available-\/arm-\/gnu-\/linux-\/g-\/lite-\/builds-\/for-\/mac-\/os-\/x}

\subsubsection*{Uploading}

Optimzing for size (-\/\+Os) is preferred. As ev3duder doesn\textquotesingle{}t handle remote debugging yet and A\+F\+A\+I\+K nothing else does, debug symbols should be skipped too (no need for -\/g).

Example commands to compile, upload and execute\+: \$ arm-\/linux-\/gnueabi-\/gcc main.\+c file.\+c -\/\+Os -\/o test \$ ev3duder up test.\+elf ../prjs/\+Brk\+Prg\+\_\+\+S\+A\+V\+E/test \$ ev3duder mkrbf /home/a3f/lms2012/\+Brk\+Prg\+\_\+\+S\+A\+V\+E/test test.\+rbf \$ ev3duder up test.\+rbf ../prjs/\+Brk\+Prg\+\_\+\+S\+A\+V\+E/test.rbf \$ ev3duder run test.\+rbf

Alternatively, steps 4 and 5 can be omitted and the last step changed to {\ttfamily ev3duder exec test.\+rbf}; The downside of this is that no menu entry is generated. Another option is also {\itshape installing} the application, which will make it available with an optional icon in the apps menu\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ ev3duder up test.rbf ../apps/test.rbf
\end{DoxyVerb}


For uploading to a S\+D Card, the paths {\ttfamily /media/card} or {\ttfamily ../prjs/\+S\+D\+\_\+\+Card/} can be used instead. A connected U\+S\+B stick would be available under {\ttfamily /media/usb/}. Keep in mind that the Lego Menu doesn\textquotesingle{}t show .rbf files at the root of the S\+D card, so it needs to be uploaded into a directory. {\ttfamily ev3duder up} does create the paths by default.

\subsection*{Documentation}

As the commands ev3duder supports mirror the functions internally used to implement them, the doxygen documentation of \mbox{[}\char`\"{}funcs.\+h\char`\"{}\mbox{]} should do as user manual. It\textquotesingle{}s available at \href{https://a3f.github.io/ev3duder}{\tt https\+://a3f.\+github.\+io/ev3duder} or can be locally generated by running {\ttfamily doxygen} and openning the index.\+html file in a webbrowser.

\subsubsection*{Language}

The utlity is written in G\+N\+U C99. The Makefile is G\+N\+U Make specific. The perl and shell scripts are complementary and not necessary.
